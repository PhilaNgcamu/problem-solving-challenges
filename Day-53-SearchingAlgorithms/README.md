<h1>Searching Algorithms</h1>

<h2>Linear Search</h2>

- Linear Search: Search for data one at a time. Example: Let's search for 12 in this given array: [5, 8, 1, 100, 12, 3, 12].
- So, the algorithm will start at index 0 and check if a value is 12, if not move to the next index and so on to find 12. If it's found/not found then return a relevant result.
- Linear Search Big O: Remember that in Big O, a general trend of the graph or the worst case scenario.
