# Problem Solving: Day 51 - Udemy - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

<h1>Intro To Problem Solving Patterns</h2>
<h2>Frequency Counters</h2>

- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values and compare them if they have similar values.
- This can often **avoid the need for nested loops** or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.

An example in [same.js](same.js) and [anagrams.js](anagrams.js)

<h2>Multiple Pointers<h2>

- Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.
- **Very** efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

An example in [sumZero.js](sumZero.js)

<h2>Sliding Window Pattern<h2>

- This pattern involves creating a **window** which can either be an array or number from one position to another.

- Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)

- Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
