# Problem Solving: Day 66 - Udemy - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

<h1>Graphs</h1>

- A collection of nodes and the connection between those nodes. The connections are _much more_ important.

<h2>Uses of Graphs</h2>

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- EVERYWHERE!

<h2>Types of Graphs</h2>

Essential graph terms:

- **Vertex** - a node
- **Edge** - connection between those nodes
- **Weight/Unweighted** - values assigned to distances between vertices
- **Directed/Undirected** - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

<h2>Representing A Graphs</h2>

- Adjacency Matrix - use nested arrays
- Adjacency List - use nested arrays

<h2>Adjacency List vs. Adjacency Matrix</h2>

- Adjacency List
  - Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
  - Faster to iterate over all edges
  - Can be slower to lookup at specific edges
- Adjacency Matrix
  - Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
  - Slower to iterate over all edges
  - Faster to lookup specific edge
