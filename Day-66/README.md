<h1>Graphs</h1>

- A collection of nodes and the connection between those nodes. The connections are _much more_ important.

<h2>Uses of Graphs</h2>

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- EVERYWHERE!

<h2>Types of Graphs</h2>

Essential graph terms:

- **Vertex** - a node
- **Edge** - connection between those nodes
- **Weight/Unweighted** - values assigned to distances between vertices
- **Directed/Undirected** - directions assigned to distanced between vertices
