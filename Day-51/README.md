Solved 0 problems this day.

How to solve any problem:

1. How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

3. What should the output look like from the inputs we have? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

4. Break down the problem (pseudocode)

5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
