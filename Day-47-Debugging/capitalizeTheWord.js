// A new programmer was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

// Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case).

function capitalizeWord(word) {
  word[0].toUpperCase();
  return word;
}

//1.How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

//3. What should the output look like? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

//4. Break down the problem (psedocode)
//--then code (if the problem is difficult, let's come up with examples to solidify our understanding)

//5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
