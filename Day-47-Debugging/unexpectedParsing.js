//Here's a pice of code:
// function getStatus(isBusy) {
//     var msg = (isBusy ? "busy" : "available");
//     return
//     {
//       status: msg
//     }
//   }

// Expected Behaviour:
// Function should return a dictionary/Object/Hash with "status" as a key, whose value can : "busy" or "available" depending on the truth value of the argument 'is_busy'.

//1.How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

//3. What should the output look like from the inputs we have? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

//4. Break down the problem (pseudocode)
//--do we have any errors on our given code (line by line / block of code)? How do we fix that?
//--then code (if the problem is difficult, let's come up with examples to solidify our understanding)

//5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
