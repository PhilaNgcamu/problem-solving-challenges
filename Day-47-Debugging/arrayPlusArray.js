// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
//     return arr1 + arr2; //something went wrong
//   }

//1.How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

//3. What should the output look like? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

//4. Break down the problem (psedocode)
//--do we have any errors on our given code? How do we fix that?
//--then code (if the problem is difficult, let's come up with examples to solidify our understanding)

//5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
