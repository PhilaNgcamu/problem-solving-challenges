// While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.

// checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.

// The function receives one parameter health which will always be a whole number between -10 and 10.

// function checkAlive (health) {
//     if () {
//       health < 0
//       return false
//     } else () {
//       return true
//     }
//   }
//1.How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

//3. What should the output look like? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

//4. Break down the problem (psedocode)
//--do we have any errors on our given code?
//--then code (if the problem is difficult, let's come up with examples to solidify our understanding)

//5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
