// Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

// Can you help her?

// function greet(name) {
//   return "Hello, " + name + "!";
//   if (name === "Johnny") return "Hello, my love!";
// }

//1.How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

//2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

//3. What should the output look like from the inputs we have? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

//4. Break down the problem (pseudocode)
//--do we have any errors on our given code (line by line / block of code)? How do we fix that?
//--then code (if the problem is difficult, let's come up with examples to solidify our understanding)

//5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
