<h2>How to identify if a problem would be solved recursively?</h2>

- Practice, practice, practice!
- See if the smaller version can be solved to figure out if a problem can be solved recursively.
- Therefore, if it forms a pattern - it is called a recurrence relation, which helps us find the next term if we have the previous term.
- The base condition is when we know if the term is already equal to a knwn answer.
