// For this challenge you will be manipulating a string using dashes (-).
// have the function DashInsertII(str) insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers and insert asterisks ('*') between each two even numbers in str. For example: if str is 4546793 the output should be 454*67-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd or even number.
function dashInsertII(str) {
  return str;
}
console.log(dashInsertII(4546793));
// 1. How can we restate the problem, in your own words?
//Insert dashes between odd numbers and insert asterisks between even numbers
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
//string of numbers

// 3. What should the output look like from the inputs we have? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)
//input: "1223455567" --> "12*2345-5-567"
// 4. Break down the problem (pseudocode)
// 
// 5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
