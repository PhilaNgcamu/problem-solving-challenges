// 1. How can we restate the problem, in your own words?

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

// 3. What should the output look like from the inputs we have? (Do we understand how the solution would look like?)

// 4. Break down the problem (pseudocode)

// 5. refactor the solved problem (if possible)
