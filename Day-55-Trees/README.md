<h1>Binary Search Trees</h1>

- A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship.
- Lists are linear but trees are non-linear. SO trees have a different parts to nodes.
- Note that if a node references to a node that is not below it, then it's not it's child. Therefore, not a tree.
