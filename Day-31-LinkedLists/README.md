<h1>linked Lists</h1>

- A linked list is a linear data structure (ordered collection of data)
- It can be represented by a diagram, where the head: is the working data and next: the reference to the next data.
- In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

<h2>Creating Nodes</h2>

- Reference: [linkedLists.js](linkedlists.js).
- Declare the class, Node which takes in 2 parameters (data, next), where _data_ is the actual working data and _next_ is the pointer to the next node.
- If there is no preceeding node set the next variable to _null_.
- Then create an instance for the node.
