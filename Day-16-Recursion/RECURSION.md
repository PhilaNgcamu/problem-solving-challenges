<h1>JavaScript Recursive Function</h1>

- A **recursive** function is a function that calles itself until it doens't. Reference: [recursion.js](recursion.js).

- How? The recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself. Where a condition is met then the recursive function will stop.

- Why use recursive functions? We generally want to break a big problem into smaller ones. Mostly, you will find them in data structures like binary trees and grapsh and algorithms such as binary search and quick sort

- The examples are in [recursion.js](recursion.js)
