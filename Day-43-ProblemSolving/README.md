<h1>Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Understand the problem</h2>

- 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (what should the output look like)
- 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem)
- 5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

<h2>Step 2: Concrete examples</h2>

Coming up with examples can help you **better** understand the problem. This provides some degree of confidence that the solution works how it should.

When you are faced with a problem:

- Do all step 1 and start with simple examples.
- Then, progress to more complex examples
- Then, progress to explore more examples with empty inputs and/ or invalid inputs.

<h2>Step 3: Break It Down</h2>

Explicitly write down the steps you need to take - which **forces** to think about the code you'll write before you write it and helps you catch potential misunderstandngs before diving into the code.

<h2>Step 4: Solve or simplify</h2>

- Find the **core difficulty** in what you're trying to do.
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then, incorporate that difficulty back in

<h2>Step 4: Solve or simplify</h2>

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some problem?
- Can you improve the perfomance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved it?
