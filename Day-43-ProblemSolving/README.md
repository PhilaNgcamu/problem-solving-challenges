<h1>Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Understand the problem</h2>

- 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (what should the output look like)
- 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem)
- 5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
