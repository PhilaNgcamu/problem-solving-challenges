<h1>Analysing the performance of Objects and Arrays<h1>

<h2>Big O of Objects</h2>

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(1)

<h2>Big O of Object Methods</h2>

- Object.keys - O(N)
- Object.values - O(N)
- Object.entries - O(N)
- hasOwnProperty - O(1)

<h2>Big O of Arrays</h2>

- Insertion - It depends, if I want to insert a value at the beginning of the array then the perfomance will be slower than adding it at the end because the array re-initializes indeces to values.
- Removal - It depends, if I want to remove a value from the array then the perfomance will be slower because the array re-initializes indeces to values.
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(N)

> NOTE: Push and Pop array methods are faster than Shift and Unshift

<h2>Big O of Array Operations</h2>

- Push, pop - O(1)
- Shift, unshift - O(N)
- sort - O(N \* log N)
- forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. - O(N)

<h1>Problem Solving</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Understand the problem</h2>

- 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (what should the output look like)
- 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem)
- 5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
