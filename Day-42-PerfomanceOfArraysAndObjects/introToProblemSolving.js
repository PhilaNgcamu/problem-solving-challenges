// Write a function which two numbers and returns their sum

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// add 2 numbers
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// Is it floats, integers or strings of numbers
// Assume that it always takes 2 numbers
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (what should the output look like)
// should the out be an integer, float or string?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem)
// If yes, then you can jump to number. If no, take your time to understand the problem
// 5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
// Write a function that takes in 2 arguments? then return their sum defined in a variable or not.
