<h1>Permutations and Combinations</h1>

- Permutations are associated with _arranging_ things in different order and the **order matters**.
- Combinations are associated with _combining_ things and the **order DOESN'T matter**.

Example:

1. arrange 2 letters of these letters `ABCD` each. The answer is:
   - Permutations is equal to 12 and Combinations is equal to 6.

```
AB, AC, AD,
BA, BC, BD,
CA, CB, CD,
DA, DB, DC
```

2. Use equations for Permutations and Combinations.
   - For Permutations: **nPr = n!/(n - r)!,** where n = total number of things, r = no of the letters which will be arranges and P = Permutations.
   - For Combinations: **nCr = n!/(n - r)! \* 1/r!**, where n = total number of things, r = no of the letters which will be arranges and C = Combinations.
